1. If you want to reproduce the experiment, you need to at least have the python 3.8, the newest version of pytorch and NVIDIA GPU  RTX4090 or beyond.
2. In the source code we don't add a random seed in it so that't may cause different results in the report. Later, we would fix problem, or if you have more creative idea to change the code for  better, very welcome to learn with each other.
3. the code can be directly used without any pre-settup unless you don't have any environment of python.
